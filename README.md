# Risk-of-Chronic-Heart-Disease

This is a project that I did with one of my classmates for my final assessment in the course Applied Linear Models at University of Waterloo. The dataset used for data analysis comes from the Framingham Heart Study, and it focuses on the Framingham Risk Score - a score for risk of chronic heart disease assigned to an individual based on their health-related indexes. The project involves finding the relationship between this Risk Score and some explanatory variables by applying logistic regression models and cross validation.
